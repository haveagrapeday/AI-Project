        - **Dataset Source**: Kaggle (Harry Potter Dialogue Dataset)
        - **Data Files Used**: 
            - `Dialogue.csv` - Contains dialogues spoken by characters.
            - `Characters.csv` - Contains metadata about characters.
        - **Data Cleaning**:
            - Removing missing/null values
            - Standardizing text format
            - Merging datasets using `Character_ID`

        - **Algorithm Used**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) with **TF-IDF + Classification Model**.
        - **Why NLP?**:
            - Dialogues are text-based, requiring text processing techniques.
            - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) helps extract important words.
        - **Classification Model**:
            - Decision Tree / Random Forest / SVM are considered for classifying dialogue patterns.

        1. **Load and Clean Data**: Read CSV files, clean missing values, and merge datasets.
        2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, removing stopwords, and applying TF-IDF.
        3. **Train/Test Split**: Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
        4. **Train the Model**: Use a classification algorithm like Random Forest.
        5. **Evaluate Performance**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall using confusion matrix.

        - The dataset contains valuable insights into character dialogues.
        - NLP techniques help extract meaningful patterns from text.
        - A classification model can help determine which character a dialogue belongs to.
        - Further improvements can include deep learning approaches like transformers (BERT).
